- You can create your own application in your VPC and configure it as an AWS PrivateLink-powered service (referred to as an endpoint service). Other AWS principals can create a connection from their VPC to your endpoint service using an interface VPC endpoint. You are the service provider, and the AWS principals that create connections to your service are service consumers.
